# Description
**Provided by instructor.**
The game takes place in on a grid of squares, 16 squares wide and 14 tall. The user controls the snake, which starts as only 2 squares long.

The snake moves forward automatically, and the player can turn the snake’s head in any direction. The rest of the snake’s body follows the path that the head takes.

The snake eats apples, which are randomly located on the grid. Every time the snake eats an apple, it gets one square longer, the apple disappears, and a new apple is placed randomly somewhere else on the grid.

If the snake eats 20 apples, the game is over and the player wins.

If the snake moves off the sides of the grid, or runs into its own body, the game is over and the player loses.
